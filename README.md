# ch9sortingBenchmarks

Create a project that has two identical arrays of 25 elements of random numbers in the range of 1 to 500. The arrays need to be identical, so create a random number and store it in the same element in both arrays. Write a function that displays the contents of an array, with 5 elements on a line. Write a function that uses a bubble sort to sort the first array in ascending order, counting the number of swaps it makes. Write a function that uses a selection sort to sort the second array in ascending order, counting the number of swaps it makes. The project will display one array, sort it using the bubble sort function, and display the changed array, then repeat for the second array using the selection sort. When done, display the results of the counts for both sorts. Take a screenshot.

Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
